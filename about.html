  	<h2> About Mad Libs </h2>
  	<p>
Mad Libs, created in 1953, is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the often comical or nonsensical story aloud.</p>
<p id="p1"> The blanks are usually subsituted by words with different parts of speech. For example, there can be verbs, adjectives, or any other parts of speech to replace the blanks.</p>
